Add Ivan's research to README
Gradient descent from Ivan exercise
Reverse left/right of clusters vs. timepoints graph
Increase in v-measure with ground truth knowledge -- only tiny, so knowing ground truth doesn't help much because of poor data quality
Add exercise for changing means to make clearly distinct clusters and seeing if you get "right" answer
