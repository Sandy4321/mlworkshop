Mention that under supervised learning, we have classification and regression
Reverse left/right of clusters vs. timepoints graph
Increase in v-measure with ground truth knowledge -- only tiny, so knowing ground truth doesn't help much because of poor data quality
Fix the outlier slide
Note that the exact form of the logistic regression function doesn't matter -- it's just convenient
