# GLBIO 2016 machine learning workshop

## Outline

This workshop covers biological applications of dimensionality reduction,
clustering, and supervised learning.

Each topic is presented in its own Jupyter notebook.

1. [Dimensionality reduction](dimensionality_reduction/Dimensionality_reduction.ipynb)
2. [Clustering](clustering/Clustering.ipynb)
3. [Supervised learning](supervised_learning/Supervised_learning.ipynb)


## Prerequisites

### Suggested installation

To install Python and the associated packages necessary to use these notebooks, the easiest option is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). We recommend using the most recent version, which is currently Anaconda for Python 3.5.

### Manual installation (advanced users)

If you're an advanced user who is not using Anaconda, install the following packages:

* [jupyter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter)
* [pandas](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas)
* [plotly](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plotly)
* [scikit-learn](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-learn)
