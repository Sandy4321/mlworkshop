# GLBIO 2016 machine learning workshop

## Outline

This workshop covers biological applications of dimensionality reduction,
clustering, and supervised learning.

Each topic is presented in its own Jupyter notebook.

1. [Supervised learning](supervised_learning/Supervised_learning.ipynb)
2. [Dimensionality reduction](dimensionality_reduction/Dimensionality_reduction.ipynb)
3. [Clustering](clustering/Clustering.ipynb)


## Prerequisites

### Suggested installation

1. Install the [Anaconda Python
   distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Use the Python 3.5
   version.

2. Install Plotly. On Mac, open Terminal through Finder. On Windows, open
   Anaconda Prompt. Run this command:

         pip install plotly

### Manual installation (advanced users)

If you're an advanced user who is not using Anaconda, install the following packages:

* [jupyter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jupyter)
* [pandas](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas)
* [plotly](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plotly)
* [scikit-learn](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-learn)
