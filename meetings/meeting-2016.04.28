Include crash course on Python -- no more than ten minutes
  Maybe cover Pandas as well

I did Software Carpentry workshop
  Roaming helpers
  Sticky notes
  Instructor pauses
    Ivan: Maybe have people change what algorithm they're using for dimensionality reduction or clustering -- that would be the interactive part

Intrinsic measures:
  Two measures as objective function -- q modularity, conductancekd
  Modularity: whole group of algorithms based on maximizing modularity
    Bounded between -1/2 and 1
  PNAS paper points out one problem with modularity
    New class of algorithms came out to fix this problem
    New group of algorithms combined optimization with hierarchical structure -- fixes problem with q-modularity

Ivan: early cells are much more distinguished from each other than later ones
  After 48 h, the cells are more distinguished from each other
  Cell type: myoblasts

Compare results to the Sincell vignette

Two constraints already expressed on data we're using:
  Nonzero in >50 cells -- otherwise discard
  Genes must also be differentially be expressed -- q < 0.01

Shain: for classification, we should use DREAM Challenge drug sensitivity produciton data
  We can provide this data openly -- Shain checked
Ivan: we should do small writeup about what each dataset means
  I should list what features we use, and how they've been determined -- "we use this annotation pipeline", whatever
