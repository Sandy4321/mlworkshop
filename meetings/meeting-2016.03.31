In past: limit was 40 people

Bioloy/CS people
  Both should be familiar with programming and biology
  Single four-hour block
  Develop as a Jupyer notebook

  Write page or two of extended outline for each of topics we're discussing
    Classification
      Linear regression and linear 
      Training/test, cross-validation
      Regularization

    Clustering
      k-medoids and k-means
      Single-cell analysis with flow cytometry or RNA-seq -- cluster cells together to find basic cell types

    Classification example:
      http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n12/full/nbt.2877.html
      See Table 1 for the different classifiers used
        Methods, code, visualization, etc. already available for these
    Regression
    Deep learning

Single-cell:
  Hundreds or thousands of genes simultaneously
  Cell types are defined differently than we predicted
    Algorithms cluster cells to find major cell types
  http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/20/3380.long
    Look at table -- this provides uniform interface to clustering methods applied to data -- on page 2 of supplementary
    Dirichlet process priors for clustering -- do Bayesian methods
    We should use modern tools like t-SNE instead of PCA -- similar to MDS -- embed high-dimensional data in low-dimensional space

  This is good for demonstrating both clustering and dimenionsality-reduction
  Three components: dimensionality reduction, defining distance, and clustering
  We get data from Sincell paper -- lots of cases where we know the clustering, so we can apply different clustering methods, etc.
    We apply different clustering and dimensionality reduction to find subpopulations of cells

To cover:
  Clustering:
    k-means: we can look at extensions like x-means which automatically choose k
    A Dirichlet-based method -- multiple implementations
      No good implementation in Carrot or scikit-learn
      scikit-learn: DPGMM is a good choice possibly
    Do:
      k-means, automatic means of choosing k
        And a fuzzy/overlapping clustering method as well
        "If you want to have Bayesian prior, you can use this type of method ..."
      DPP version of this
        We do Gaussian mixture models as part of this

  Dimensionality reduction:
    PCA
      Show how to explore data, find underlying structure -- exploration tool in addition to combining with other models
    ICA
    t-SNE
      This is basically better impelemtantion of MVS
  Good implementation of t-SNE here: https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/

Start with dimensionality reduction
  Look at data, see if there's clustering/grouping
  Colour code the points, then see if there's correlation
    E.g., in single-cell data, you have different timepoints -- t=0, t=24h, ...
    These are different coloursÂ 
  Look at page 14 here: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/vignettes/sincell/inst/doc/sincell-vignette.pdf
    This is a good dataset to use
    Don't worry about graph building -- that's problem-specific
      Use anything prior to that that they do

Include package with code and data that people can follow along with
  We can use some of the datasets from DREAM / Synapse
    Problem: they're huge challenges
    Positive: there are well-developed methods for dealing with this
  Can maybe publish joint paper on ML data

Next: start Jupyter notebook on the GitHub
  Link to it off the wiki
  Outline links to different topics that we're covering
  Send our bios to GLBIO -- that will be included on the conference site
