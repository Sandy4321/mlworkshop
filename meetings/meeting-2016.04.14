575x271: genes by flow cells
  We cluster by genes to find similar expression profiles that change over time
  A01 through H12 -- these are indexing primers -- so, 96-well plate
    0, 24, 28, 48, 72h
  I log-transformed the data, as in the Vignette primer, and had good clustering results
    
Should we be doing classification on ClinVar?
  Is it worth doing toy examples for clustering, or just jump right to Sincell?

Multiple cell types -- not just morphology, or surface markers -- but based on transcriptional profile
  Idea: identify subsets of celltype groups
    Four timepoints, each of which may have subclasses -- that's why we do clustering
    Idea: cells are changing within time, so cells at same timepoints should cluster together
    In general: in single-cell, we want to group cells to represent cell-type groups
  Assume you didn't have timepoints -- you got bunch of cells, wanted to cluster & find patterns
    We don't want to condition on the timepoints -- goal: do clustering to find 
    We cluster on feature vector for each cell
      Two cells are similar if the overall expression of all genes are siilar

    We have 100 cells or 100 timepoints
      We want to cluster these 100 timepoints based on their expression
      All cell types where gene A was high will group together, and all where they're low will group together
    To visualize, we project timepoints as colour -- so, those that cluster together have similar colours
      How do we indicate what cluster each came from?
        Can have two side-by-side plots -- first is for true clustering (timepoints), second is the clustering you observed

    We need to show clusteirng quality -- use mutual information?
      Intrinsic measure: want to see internal modularity is high as measure of clustering quality
        May compute overall edges of weight inside the cluster versus outside the cluster
        Different clustering algorithms optimize different measures -- so, we want to sanity check via a different measure than the one that we optimized
      Extrinsic measure: do you match the ground truth?
      Another measure: stability -- if I perturb input distance matrix, how stable are the clusters?
        This is important for stochastic methods
        Even for deterministic methods, must evaluate how changes in input space change the output space

Some clustering algorithms are soft, some are hierarchical, some are deterministic, etc.
  We suggest features of the algorithms, and people can decide based on that
  Ivan: use adjusted mutual information to evaluate the clustering

We should do a brief intro -- what is supervised learning? unsupervised? reinforcement learning?
  First session:
    Cover data preprocessing in this as well
    30-45 mins for dimensionality reduction
      DR helps identify if there's underlying clustering, and to preprocess data to perform clustering
    75 mins for clustering and dimensionality reduction
    15 minute break
    90 mins for supervised techniques

  Two sessions of two hours
    Second session: SVM, SVR
    Regression, logistic regiression
    Decision trees, regression trees

We'll have this workshop in big lecture hall at the moment -- but we might get a computer lab
  With notebooks, people can follow along with what we're doing on a cell-by-cell basis
  Previous structure:
    One instructor talking, two moving around to help resolve problems as they arise
    If detailed question about one algorithm: ask the presenter
      If question about the particular example, ask the person helping with examples

  If people are running notebooks interactively, they must be able to follow along -- code can't take too long
    Can we have master hosted notebook, so people don't have to install the dependencies?
    Can we have the notebooks check via a certain cell to see if people have all the dependencies they need?
  
There's also a notebooks workshop at GLBIO
  We're maxed out at 90 attendees for the workshop

Ivan: we have too much material now
  After we've developed, review it and see how well it fits together
  To understand the concept, we don't necessarily need to present all the algorithms
