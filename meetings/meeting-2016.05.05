Should we cover neural nets?
  Maybe we can integrate TensorFlow

Next week, Shahin won't be here
  Can we record the workshop? Ask Belinda
  Is anyone responsible for it? Is there any equipment?

Send material to Belinda for what prerequisites are, link to Github, etc.
  Printed material: Schedule, requirements, instructor info

Ivan comes in the Sunday evening
